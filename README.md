# Template for GFraMe based games on itch.io

This template has all needed libs to easily package a game made with GFraMe for
uploading it to itch.io.

It also has a script ready to check which libs are already installed and which
should be used from the package.

To use it, the following must be done:
  - Add game's binaries and assets to 'game/' directory
  - Modify 'launch.sh' and assign the game name and the path to its log
  - zip folder
